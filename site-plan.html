        <h3>Our Projects</h3>
        <p> Aquaponics is a combination of a couple of different farming techniques: 
            Hydroponics, which is growing plants without the use of soil, and aquaculture, 
            which is growing fish or other aquatic animals.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            Mushrooms are a crop that most people don't consider when it comes to farming.
            But there's a big demand for them, and often a lack of supply depending on where
            you're located.
